        but some problems occurred that led to the separation of some individuals, and the team suffered for three years until
        <mark>2018</mark>.
         With the return of Commander Karim after his very serious injury, the team’s conditions improved to the best.
         <mark>By 5 years</mark> ,
          the team members managed to reach perfection football until we played 301 matches, we were able to win
           <mark>301</mark> matches, draw
           <mark>11 matches</mark>,
           and lose in only11 matches <mark>3</mark>  matches, and we were the best and most developed team in this period.<Br>

He leaved the team in<mark> 2016 </mark>and back again in <mark> 2021</mark> 

Back then the team was relegated to the second division<br>


Because there was a lot of  transfers and the escape of players from the  
team such as "Nour" and "Adel" Because of the team's reliance on new attackers<br>
 and the lack of a<mark> playmaker</mark>

And they want to have a chance<br>

But kisho back for the first time in<mark> 2021 </mark>
     

And he was just like a hero for the team 

He bring the team soul and he can led the team to the first division again<br>
